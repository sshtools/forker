	 *            uses the specified credentials as the default credentials.
	 * 
	 *            This value can be used to create a process that uses a
	 *            different set of credentials locally than it does remotely.
	 *            This is useful in inter-domain scenarios where there is no
	 *            trust relationship.
	 * 
	 *            The system does not validate the specified credentials.
	 *            Therefore, the process can start, but it may not have access
	 *            to network resources.
	 * @param lpApplicationName
	 * 
	 *            The name of the module to be executed. This module can be a
	 *            Windows-based application. It can be some other type of module
	 *            (for example, MS-DOS or OS/2) if the appropriate subsystem is
	 *            available on the local computer.
	 * 
	 *            The string can specify the full path and file name of the
	 *            module to execute or it can specify a partial name. If it is a
	 *            partial name, the function uses the current drive and current
	 *            directory to complete the specification. The function does not
	 *            use the search path. This parameter must include the file name
	 *            extension; no default extension is assumed.
	 * 
	 *            The lpApplicationName parameter can be NULL, and the module
	 *            name must be the first white space–delimited token in the
	 *            lpCommandLine string. If you are using a long file name that
	 *            contains a space, use quoted strings to indicate where the
	 *            file name ends and the arguments begin; otherwise, the file
	 *            name is ambiguous.
	 * 
	 *            For example, the following string can be interpreted in
	 *            different ways:
	 * 
	 *            "c:\program files\sub dir\program name"
	 * 
	 *            The system tries to interpret the possibilities in the
	 *            following order:
	 * 
	 *            c:\program.exe files\sub dir\program name c:\program
	 *            files\sub.exe dir\program name c:\program files\sub
	 *            dir\program.exe name c:\program files\sub dir\program name.exe
	 * 
	 *            If the executable module is a 16-bit application,
	 *            lpApplicationName should be NULL, and the string pointed to by
	 *            lpCommandLine should specify the executable module and its
	 *            arguments.
	 * 
	 * @param lpCommandLine
	 * 
	 *            The command line to be executed. The maximum length of this
	 *            string is 1024 characters. If lpApplicationName is NULL, the
	 *            module name portion of lpCommandLine is limited to MAX_PATH
	 *            characters.
	 * 
	 *            The function can modify the contents of this string.
	 *            Therefore, this parameter cannot be a pointer to read-only
	 *            memory (such as a const variable or a literal string). If this
	 *            parameter is a constant string, the function may cause an
	 *            access violation.
	 * 
	 *            The lpCommandLine parameter can be NULL, and the function uses
	 *            the string pointed to by lpApplicationName as the command
	 *            line.
	 * 
	 *            If both lpApplicationName and lpCommandLine are non-NULL,
	 *            *lpApplicationName specifies the module to execute, and
	 *            *lpCommandLine specifies the command line. The new process can
	 *            use GetCommandLine to retrieve the entire command line.
	 *            Console processes written in C can use the argc and argv
	 *            arguments to parse the command line. Because argv[0] is the
	 *            module name, C programmers typically repeat the module name as
	 *            the first token in the command line.
	 * 
	 *            If lpApplicationName is NULL, the first white space–delimited
	 *            token of the command line specifies the module name. If you
	 *            are using a long file name that contains a space, use quoted
	 *            strings to indicate where the file name ends and the arguments
	 *            begin (see the explanation for the lpApplicationName
	 *            parameter). If the file name does not contain an extension,
	 *            .exe is appended. Therefore, if the file name extension is
	 *            .com, this parameter must include the .com extension. If the
	 *            file name ends in a period with no extension, or if the file
	 *            name contains a path, .exe is not appended. If the file name
	 *            does not contain a directory path, the system searches for the
	 *            executable file in the following sequence:
	 * 
	 *            The directory from which the application loaded. The current
	 *            directory for the parent process. The 32-bit Windows system
	 *            directory. Use the GetSystemDirectory function to get the path
	 *            of this directory. The 16-bit Windows system directory. There
	 *            is no function that obtains the path of this directory, but it
	 *            is searched. The Windows directory. Use the
	 *            GetWindowsDirectory function to get the path of this
	 *            directory. The directories that are listed in the PATH
	 *            environment variable. Note that this function does not search
	 *            the per-application path specified by the App Paths registry
	 *            key. To include this per-application path in the search
	 *            sequence, use the ShellExecute function.
	 * 
	 *            The system adds a null character to the command line string to
	 *            separate the file name from the arguments. This divides the
	 *            original string into two strings for internal processing.
	 * 
	 * @param dwCreationFlags
	 *            he flags that control how the process is created. The
	 *            CREATE_DEFAULT_ERROR_MODE, CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, and
	 *            CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP flags are enabled by default— even if

	 *            parameter is NULL, the new process uses an environment created
	 *            from the profile of the user specified by lpUsername.
	 * 
	 *            An environment block consists of a null-terminated block of
	 *            null-terminated strings. Each string is in the following form:
	 * 
	 *            name=value
	 * 
	 *            Because the equal sign (=) is used as a separator, it must not
	 *            be used in the name of an environment variable.
	 * 
	 *            An environment block can contain Unicode or ANSI characters.
	 *            If the environment block pointed to by lpEnvironment contains
	 *            Unicode characters, ensure that dwCreationFlags includes
	 *            CREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT. If this parameter is NULL and the
	 *            environment block of the parent process contains Unicode
	 *            characters, you must also ensure that dwCreationFlags includes
	 *            CREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT.
	 * 
	 *            An ANSI environment block is terminated by two 0 (zero) bytes:
	 *            one for the last string and one more to terminate the block. A
	 *            Unicode environment block is terminated by four zero bytes:
	 *            two for the last string and two more to terminate the block.
	 * 
	 *            To retrieve a copy of the environment block for a specific
	 *            user, use the CreateEnvironmentBlock function.
	 * 
	 * @param lpCurrentDirectory
	 * 
	 *            The full path to the current directory for the process. The
	 *            string can also specify a UNC path.
	 * 
	 *            If this parameter is NULL, the new process has the same
	 *            current drive and directory as the calling process. This
	 *            feature is provided primarily for shells that need to start an
	 *            application, and specify its initial drive and working
	 *            directory.
	 * 
	 * @param lpStartupInfo
	 *            A pointer to a STARTUPINFO or STARTUPINFOEX structure. The
	 *            application must add permission for the specified user account
	 *            to the specified window station and desktop, even for
	 *            WinSta0\Default.
	 * 
	 *            If the lpDesktop member is NULL or an empty string, the new
	 *            process inherits the desktop and window station of its parent
	 *            process. The application must add permission for the specified
	 *            user account to the inherited window station and desktop.
	 * 
	 *            Windows XP: CreateProcessWithLogonW adds permission for the
	 *            specified user account to the inherited window station and
	 *            desktop.
	 * 
	 *            Handles in STARTUPINFO or STARTUPINFOEX must be closed with
	 *            CloseHandle when they are no longer needed. Important If the
	 *            dwFlags member of the STARTUPINFO structure specifies
	 *            STARTF_USESTDHANDLES, the standard handle fields are copied
	 *            unchanged to the child process without validation. The caller
	 *            is responsible for ensuring that these fields contain valid
	 *            handle values. Incorrect values can cause the child process to
	 *            misbehave or crash. Use the Application Verifier runtime
	 *            verification tool to detect invalid handles.
	 * 
	 * @param lpProcessInfo
	 * 
	 *            A pointer to a PROCESS_INFORMATION structure that receives
	 *            identification information for the new process, including a
	 *            handle to the process.
	 * 
	 *            Handles in PROCESS_INFORMATION must be closed with the
	 *            CloseHandle function when they are not needed.
	 * 
	 * @return If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.
	 * 
	 *         If the function fails, the return value is 0 (zero). To get
	 *         extended error information, call GetLastError.
	 * 
	 *         Note that the function returns before the process has finished
	 *         initialization. If a required DLL cannot be located or fails to
	 *         initialize, the process is terminated. To get the termination
	 *         status of a process, call GetExitCodeProcess.
